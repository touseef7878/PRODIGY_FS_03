# LocalStore - Build Documentation

## Project Overview
This is an e-commerce application built with React frontend and designed to support both customer and admin users. The application includes product browsing, shopping cart, checkout with mobile payments, and an admin panel for store management.

## Recent Changes: Authentication System Implementation

### Header Redesign
- **Removed** the prominent "Admin" button from the middle of the header
- **Added** a user profile icon (person/avatar) in the top-right corner of the header
- **Implemented** dropdown menu functionality for the user profile icon

### Authentication System Implementation
- **Created** a role selection page to choose between User and Admin roles
- **Implemented** User login/signup page with proper validation
- **Implemented** Admin login page with fixed credentials
- **Created** AuthContext for managing authentication state
- **Added** token-based authentication with localStorage persistence
- **Implemented** role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Added** proper session management (login/logout)

### Login Flows
- **User Login/Signup**: Email/password authentication with validation
- **Admin Login**: Fixed credentials (admin@localstore.pk / admin123)
- **Consistent Design**: All login flows use the same color scheme, gradients, and rounded styling as the rest of the application

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Professional Login Cards**: Centered, responsive cards with consistent styling
- **Role Selection Screen**: Clean interface to choose between customer and admin
- **User Profile Dropdown**: Shows user name and provides logout option when authenticated
- **Unauthorized Access Handling**: Proper redirects and messages for restricted pages
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes with adaptive layouts

### Code Structure Changes
- **Added** AuthContext and AuthProvider for authentication state management
- **Modified** Header component to support authentication state
- **Created** LoginSelection, UserLogin, and AdminLogin components
- **Enhanced** Main App component to handle authentication state and routing
- **Added** CSS for new components and authentication flows

### Security & Session Management
- **Token-based Authentication**: Using localStorage for token management
- **Role-based Access Control**: Ensuring users only access allowed features
- **Secure Logout**: Proper cleanup of authentication tokens
- **Session Persistence**: Maintaining login state across page reloads

### Admin Panel Access
- **Admin Authentication**: Required for accessing admin panel
- **Credentials**: Fixed credentials for demo purposes (admin@localstore.pk / admin123)
- **Unauthorized Access**: Proper handling when non-admins try to access admin panel

### Order Management
- **User Features**: Place orders, track with order ID
- **Admin Features**: View transactions, update tracking status
- **Role-based Access**: Different features available based on user role

## How to Run the Application

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for frontend)
- Python (for backend, if applicable)

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Backend Setup (if applicable)
```bash
cd backend
# Set up virtual environment if needed
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Authentication Flow Explained

1. **Header Interaction**: Click the user profile icon in the top-right corner
2. **Role Selection**: Choose between "Customer" or "Admin" role
3. **Login/Signup**:
   - For Customer: Either create new account or login
   - For Admin: Use fixed credentials
4. **Authentication Validation**: Credentials are validated (client-side for demo)
5. **Token Storage**: Authentication token and user data stored in localStorage
6. **UI Updates**: Interface updates based on authentication state and role
7. **Logout**: Accessible through user profile dropdown menu

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/App.jsx`: Added authentication context, login components, and updated main component
- `frontend/src/App.css`: Added CSS for new authentication components
- `frontend/src/index.css`: Updated base styles
- `README.md`: Added documentation for the new features
- `BUILD.md`: This file documenting the changes

## Testing Authentication
1. **Customer Flow**: Click profile icon → Select "Customer" → Login/Signup → Browse and shop
2. **Admin Flow**: Click profile icon → Select "Admin" → Login with admin credentials → Access admin panel
3. **Logout**: Click profile icon → Select logout from dropdown menu
4. **Unauthorized Access**: Try accessing admin panel when not logged in/without admin role

## Security Notes
- This implementation uses client-side authentication with localStorage for demo purposes
- In production, authentication should be handled server-side with proper token validation
- Admin credentials are hardcoded for demo purposes
- Passwords are not actually validated in this client-side demo
